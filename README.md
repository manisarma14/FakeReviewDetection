Overview:


Fake Review Detection is a machine learning project aimed at identifying fraudulent reviews in online platforms. This project uses various techniques in natural language processing (NLP) and classification algorithms to detect fake reviews based on text data.

Features:


Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares text data for modeling.


Text Vectorization: Uses methods like CountVectorizer to convert text into numerical data.


Model Training: Implements various classification algorithms, including SVM with different kernels.


Evaluation: Provides performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and visualizations like confusion matrices.
